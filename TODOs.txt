List of current to-dos for nn_c (priortity decreasing)
------------------------------------------------------

- Get GPU execution working.

- Overall project restructure for better general framework use.
    - Eventual python bindings.
    - Heterogenious hardware, rocm, metal, etc...
    - General project cleanup and reorganization, current strucutre is a bit messy in my opinion.
    - Keeping modularity in mind for future contributors.
    - Unified function signature conventions for activations/layers/loss

- Decouple adam optimizer from GPUNeuralNet

- More comprehensive unit tests. Gtest exploration?

- Benchmarking framework

- Arena allocator for CPU memory.

- Explore other parallelism strategies like MPI/OpenMP

- Python bindings?

- Operator based autodiff?
